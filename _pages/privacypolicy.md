# Privacy Policy
## Personal Data
We do not collect any of your data. Nothing.

Everything you do is saved on-device and to your iCloud, which is synced across your devices using the same iCloud account.

We don't display any ads or send anything to any server. So we don't track you using an advertising identifier or anything of the sort.

Thanks a lot for using Days OnSite, and we hope you're happy with it.
