# Privacy Policy

## Personal Data
We do not collect any of your data. Nothing.

Everything you do is saved on-device and to your iCloud, which is synced across your devices using the same iCloud account.

## Susbscriptions
The app uses anonymous user IDâ€™s, and does not have a way to link them to any individual's information (eg. name, address). This is required for receipt validation in order to prevent fraud when a subscription purchase is made.

## Advertising 
We don't display any ads or send user's behaviour to any server. So we don't track you by using an advertising identifier or anything of the sort.

Thanks a lot for using Days OnSite, and we hope you're happy with it.

## Any Question?
If you have any issues to report or feedback about this privacy policy or anything else, you can contact us at [contact@daysonsite.app](mailto:contact@daysonsite.app)
