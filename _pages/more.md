### Let's improve performance together.
Day to day activities for a Clinical Research Associate include: scheduling visits, tracking due dates for reports, confirmation and follow up letters and moreâ€¦

As a CRA, I decided to develop a mobile application that allowed me to create recurrent visits and have projections of my days on site in order to reach my goals. I started to add more and more features to meet my needs. One day I showed my app to a colleague and his excitement and feedback gave me the fuel I needed to start to materialize this project into a full-fledged app for every CRA. I got validation that I was on the right track.

Let me share some of the screens of the app and please [subscribe for news on the official release date](http://eepurl.com/g0ksrn) and the future of the app. 

At this time the best way to connect with the project is to follow Days OnSite App on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/daysonsiteapp/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/daysonsiteapp) and let me know what do you think of the project.
