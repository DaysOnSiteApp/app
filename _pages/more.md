### Let's improve performance together.
Day to day activities for a Clinical Research Associate include: scheduling visits, tracking due dates for reports, confirmation and follow up letters and moreâ€¦

As a CRA, I decided to develop a mobile application that allowed me to create recurrent visits and have projections of my days on site in order to reach my goals. I started to add more and more features to meet my needs. One day I showed my app to a colleague and his excitement and feedback gave me the fuel I needed to start to materialize this project into a full-fledged app for every CRA. I got validation that I was on the right track.
