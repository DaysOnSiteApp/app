### Let's improve performance together.
As a Clinical Research Associate our day to day activities include: scheduling visits, tracking due dates for reports, confirmation and follow up letters and more...

I decided to create a mobile application that allowed me to create recurrent visits and have projections of my days on site to reach my goals within my company, have all my visits at a glance. 

I start to add more and more features according with my needs. One day I showed my app to a colleague and his excitement and points of improvement gave me the fuel I needed to start to materialized this project into a full fledged app for every CRA. I got reaffirmation that I was in the right track.

If you got until here congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ You beat the average time span. Let me share some of the screen of the app and feel free to [subscribe for the official release date](http://eepurl.com/g0ksrn) and the future of the app. 

At this time the best way to connect with the project is following Days OnSite App on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/daysonsiteapp/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/daysonsiteapp) and let me know what do you think of the project.
