# Motivation
For a long time Clinical Research Associates have been working with old technology for doing their day to day job. 
I've been there, lots of trackers to project my visits, to track if I've sent the confirmation letter and submit the report. 
Did I already sent the follow up letter? 
That was my struggle, dealing not only with a complex protocols but also drowning in visits schedule and tracking them.

## Enough is enough 
I decided to create a mobile application that allowed me to create recurrent visits and have projections of my days on site to reach my goals within my company, have all my visits at a glance. 
When it comes to sites, if I need the address of the clinic for my next visit I needed to deep dive into the system behind login, vpn... That's not convenient while you are travelling. I added site information to the app.

I start to add more and more features according with my needs. One day I showed my app to a colleague and his excitement and points of improvement gave me the fuel needed to start to materialized this project into a full fledged app for every CRA. I got reaffirmation that I was in the right track.

If you got until here congratulations! You beat the average time span. Let me share some of the screen of the app and feel free to [subscribe for the official release date](http://eepurl.com/g0ksrn) and the future of the app.
